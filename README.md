TMG Code Challenge


## Architecture
I decided to create this project using MVVM as design pattern.

I also included a network helper, using protocol oriented programing, and dependency injection for the details view.


## Tools
- Xcode 15.3
- Swift 5
- Minimun deployment target: iOS 15 (according to requirements)


## :)
I hope you like it as much as I liked working on it.
